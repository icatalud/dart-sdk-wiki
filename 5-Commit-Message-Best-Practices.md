1. First line is a capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

1. **Always** add a blank line before more information. Many git tools assume layout.

1. More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or so.

1. When linking to an associated GitHub Issue
  * **DO NOT** put `Issue 234` in the title
  * **DO** Use the full GitHub URL to the issue - this ensures that the issue is clickable in RIETVELD
  * **DO** Use GitHub notation to auto-close bugs on commit
    * This: `Closes https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/25595`
    * Not this: `BUG=https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/25595`
  * If you don't want to delete the `BUG=` boiler plate, at least add a space after the `=`. This ensures that the issue link is clickable in RIETVELD
  
1. Write your commit message in the present tense:  "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
