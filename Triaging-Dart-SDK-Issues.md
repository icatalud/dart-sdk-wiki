##Workflow

* Look through issues that don't have an area assigned.
  * Use the [SDK triage query]
* Does the issue relate to code in the SDK?
  * Assign to the right area by adding a `Area-*` label.
* Does the issue relate to code in another `dart-lang` project/package?
  * Move the issue to the right repo by using the [GitHub Issue Mover][]
* Get emails when issues are tagged with labels you care about
  * Use the [Dart SDK email tool].
