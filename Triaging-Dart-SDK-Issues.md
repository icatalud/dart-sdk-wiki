##Workflow

* Look through issues that don't have an area assigned.
  * Use the [SDK triage query].
* Does the issue relate to code in the SDK?
  * Assign to the right area by adding a `Area-*` label.
* Is the issue in `Area-Library`?
  * Assign the right `Library-*` label, too.
* Is it obvious if the issue is a Defect or Enhancement?
  * Optional: Add `Type-Defect` or `Type-Enhancement` if you can.
* Does the issue relate to code in another `dart-lang` project/package?
  * Move the issue to the right repo by using the [GitHub Issue Mover][].
* Get emails when issues are tagged with labels you care about
  * Use the [Dart SDK email tool].
